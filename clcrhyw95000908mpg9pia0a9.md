    # My learning From KWoC
    
    It was a great initiative taken by IIT Kharagpur for the practice of GSoC and it was genuinely worth taking part in it it was motivating towards our open-source journey and i personally gonna take more and more part in such programs where i learn from other and collaborate with other to fix a problem.
    
    Mentors were very friendly and very helpful and to be honest it was a very nice experience to take part in KWoC because of the following reasons
    
* Beginner-friendly projects.
    
* Flexible Projects.
    
* Great Mentors.
    
* Variety of projects.
    
* Easy to understand
    

# Conclusion

I have learned a lot and personally have gained very much confidence where I find myself very much comfortable with open source and motivated me to contribute more and more towards it from my end my conclusion would be that everyone should contribute to open source as it is genuinely awesome and you learn a lot from it, new people, new ideas, new learnings and many more!
