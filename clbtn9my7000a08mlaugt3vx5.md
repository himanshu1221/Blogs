1 -&gt; Starting with the basics of HTML I learned some HTML at school time and I polished them and made a project on it.

2 -&gt; Then I learned CSS from Youtube, Twitter, and Docs and what I did after that I styled my projects with that.

3 -&gt; Then I learned how to use frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Material UI and made many projects on it

4 -&gt; Then I started my journey with JavaScript which was added as a backend for the basic website I learned JavaScript and made many many projects With HTML, CSS & JavaScript

‚≠ê Tip of the blog -&gt; Moving ahead you should master JavaScript to go ahead cause no Web Developer is considered a good Web Developer until they have a good command of JavaScript

5 -&gt; Then I got to know about ReactJS and I learned it and it's a nice framework to work on which makes our work easier and easier

# ‚≠ê Star Tip

A Star tip of mine would be that whatever you learn make projects on it! contribute in the open source regarding that tech stack whatever you learned.
