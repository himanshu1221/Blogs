# Okay But...Why Contribute To Open Source**‚ùì**

In this section, I will be encouraging you and pushing you towards open source by giving several perks of contributing to open source.

### Hands-on learning **üßë‚Äçüíª**

Open source provides you with the immense benefit of learning by doing ie hands-on learning, Somewhere and somehow we all somedays were stuck in tutorial hell. Open source just bust that hell and let you spread your wings and provide you with an awesome platform where you can learn by doing

### Learn in public **üåê**

By learning in public we can understand sharing our learning on our social media where people who follow you or jumps to your profile they will get to know what you are working on. Contributing to open source promotes learning in public, that public supports you and encourages you to do more good work which motivates us to push our limits

It is the most important takeaway from this blog is "Collaborative learning" Or "Learning by others", This means we can learn along with others which will work both ways which means everyone can learn from each other. We can exchange our knowledge with others and in return, we can learn about their expertise or we can explore new stuff together.
